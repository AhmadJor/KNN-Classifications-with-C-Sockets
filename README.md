This repository showcases a comprehensive implementation of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifications using C++, sockets, multithreading, OOP, and design patterns. The program takes a CSV file as input and applies a custom KNN algorithm, demonstrating a deep understanding of the subject matter.

The program is structured into two parts: a server that handles the data processing and a client that communicates with the server to receive the results. The server uses multithreading to efficiently handle multiple client requests simultaneously, demonstrating a strong understanding of multithreading concepts.

The code is written in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) style and employs several design patterns, such as the Command Design Pattern, to make the code maintainable, flexible, and scalable. This showcases the ability to apply software design principles to solve real-world problems.

This project is an excellent demonstration of your expertise in KNN algorithms, socket programming, multithreading, OOP, and design patterns in C++, and is sure to impress potential employers or collaborators.
