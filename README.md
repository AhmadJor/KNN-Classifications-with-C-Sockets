# KNN Classifications with C++ Sockets: A Comprehensive Implementation
## Introduction
This repository is a showcase of a robust and complete implementation of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifications using C++, sockets, multithreading, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and design patterns. The program takes a CSV file as input, implements a custom KNN algorithm, and provides a deep understanding of the KNN classifications.

## Architecture
The program is structured into two parts: a server that handles the data processing and a client that communicates with the server to receive the results. The server utilizes multithreading to efficiently handle multiple client requests simultaneously, demonstrating the strong understanding of multithreading concepts and their application.

## Design Patterns
The code is written in an OOP style and employs several design patterns, such as the Command Design Pattern, to make the code maintainable, flexible, and scalable. This showcases the ability to apply software design principles to real-world problems and create efficient, scalable, and robust solutions.

## Key Learnings
By working on this project, I gained expertise in the following areas:
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms
- Socket programming in C++
- Multithreading in C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++
- Design patterns in C++

## Usage
To run the program, you need to have g++ installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:
```make```
g++ server.cpp -o server
g++ client.cpp -o client
This will compile the server and client files. Then, run the server by executing ./server in one terminal window and run the client by executing ./client in another terminal window.

## Conclusion
This project is a comprehensive implementation of KNN classifications with C++ sockets and showcases your expertise in KNN algorithms, socket programming, multithreading, OOP, and design patterns in C++. It will surely impress potential employers or collaborators and demonstrate your ability to create robust, scalable, and efficient solutions.
